# 📖 Document Object Model (DOM) – Notes

Imagine your **webpage is like a big tree** 🌳.
* The **trunk** is the document (HTML file).
* The **branches** are tags like `<body>`, `<div>`, `<h1>`.
* The **leaves** are the text, images, links. 

The DOM is like a **magic remote control** 🕹️ that lets JavaScript talk to this tree → change colors, text, styles, or even add/remove parts.

## 📚 Proper Definition
The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a **programming interface for HTML and XML documents**. It represents the page as a **tree structure**, where each node is an object that JavaScript can access and manipulate.

## ⭐ Standout & Important Points
* DOM is **not HTML itself**, it's the **representation** of HTML in memory.
* Treats the page as a **tree of nodes** (Root → Branches → Leaves).
* Each element/tag/attribute/text is a **node**.
* DOM allows you to **read, add, modify, or delete** HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.
* DOM makes webpages **interactive** (otherwise they're just static HTML).

⚡ **In short: HTML builds the structure → DOM makes it alive → JavaScript controls it.**
